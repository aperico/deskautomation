# Project Glossary

The main glossary is now maintained in [README.md](../README.md#project-glossary) for onboarding and consistency.

If you add new project-specific terms, list them here and update the README.md glossary as needed.

*For questions about terminology, see the README.md glossary or open an issue.*

# ASPICE Maturity Classification

**Overall ASPICE Maturity Level: Level 2 (Managed Process)**

This project demonstrates most base practices at Level 2 maturity, meaning processes are planned, monitored, and managed, with requirements, architecture, and testing well documented and traceable. Some integration and validation steps remain partially manual, so full Level 3 (Defined Process) is not yet achieved. To reach higher maturity, further automation, standardization, and continuous improvement are recommended.

# ASPICE Assessment Checklist

**Assessment Date:** January 6, 2026


**Overall Process Maturity Statement:**
Most base practices for system and software engineering are fully or largely achieved, with strong evidence in requirements, architecture, and testing. Integration and validation steps are partially manual; further automation and documentation improvements are recommended for full ASPICE compliance.

This assessment summarizes ASPICE compliance for the Automated Mechanical Desk Lift project. It covers System (SYS) and Software Engineering (SWE) base practices, with a clear status legend and process maturity overview. Use this as a quick reference for compliance, gaps, and improvement planning.
